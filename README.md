# JAR 007: AI-Powered Multifunctional Assistant

## Description
**JAR 007** is a multifunctional, AI-powered assistant built to simplify everyday tasks, automate workflows, and provide accurate responses through an advanced voice and text-based interface. The project leverages the **Falcon-7B-Instruct LLM model** for natural, context-aware responses and integrates a robust backend (fully developed by me) with an enhanced **Vite + React** front-end for a seamless user experience.

This assistant incorporates a variety of functionalities, ranging from task automation and intelligent query handling to a voice-enabled interactive system. Its modular design and scalable architecture make it adaptable for both personal and professional use cases.

> **Note:** This application might not function optimally on certain third-party browsers like **Brave** due to compatibility issues. For the best experience, visit the project at [https://jar-007-by-shk.netlify.app/](https://jar-007-by-shk.netlify.app/).
